# Churn-Analysis-with-PySpark
You'll learn how to manipulate large and realistic datasets with Spark to engineer relevant features for predicting churn. You'll learn how to use Spark MLlib to build machine learning models with large datasets, far beyond what could be done with non-distributed technologies like scikit-learn.
